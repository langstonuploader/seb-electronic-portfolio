		<h2>Skills & Education Required</h2>
		<p>For a career in computer science it's important to have advanced computer and technology skills. It's also important to have knowledge of hardware, understanding of operating systems, proficiency in typing, and prowess in working in spreadsheets and on presentations. In the CS career, important skills required include programming in different languages, software development, mathematics, data analysis, and data visualization. In addition, soft skills such as critical thinking, attention to detail, creative problem solving, communication, and collaboration are all important to the career. No matter how proficient you are in other skills, you cannot be a journalist without good communication skills. You're required to interview sources, report news and write articles or scripts. Important communication skills include being friendly, being empathetic and confident, and effectively presenting news or information. Most computer scientists hold at least a bachelor's degree in computer science. They may also hold an undergrad degree in a related field. In addition, computer scientists may need to have additional certifications in programming languages and other various tech skills. Typically, a journalist earns a bachelor's degree in journalism, communications, or English.</p>
